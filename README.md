# Microservices Suite

## Overview

Welcome to the Microservices Suite project! This suite is a collection of microservices built on top of the Nx monorepo management framework and npm workspaces. It utilizes Docker containers and Kubernetes for orchestration, providing a scalable and efficient solution for various application needs.

## Features

This suite includes the following microservices:

1. **Notification Service**: Handles sending notifications to users via various channels such as email, SMS, or push notifications.

2. **Upload Service**: Manages file uploads, ensuring secure and efficient handling of files within the application.

3. **Payment Service**: Facilitates payment processing, integrating with payment gateways and managing transactions securely.

## Technologies Used

- **Nx Monorepo Management Framework**: Enables efficient code sharing and collaboration among multiple projects within a single repository.
  
- **npm Workspaces**: Simplifies managing multiple packages within a single repository, making it easier to handle dependencies and scripts.
  
- **Docker Containers**: Provides lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient containers for packaging and deploying microservices.
  
- **Kubernetes (k8s)**: Offers automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, ensuring reliability and scalability.
