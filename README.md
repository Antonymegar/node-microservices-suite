# Microservices Suite

## Overview

Welcome to the Microservices Suite project! This suite is a collection of node microservices built using the `mono-repo strategy` utilizing the `yarn workspaces` concept. Every `microservice` runs in her `isolated Docker container` and `Kubernetes` is used for `orchestration`, providing fluidity to scaling any service or a combo of services efficiently.

## Features

Monorepo strategy benefits for microservices:

1. **Enforce DRY principles**: Collocating code encourages code sharing, reduces code duplication as in multi-repo strategy and saves time to scaffold a microservice by building on existing boilerplate or reusable functionality.

2. **Collaboration**: Learning by reading code authored by others as you work within the same repository makes it easier to kick bad habits and pick up some good ones from your peers.

3. **Hoist common development chores**: Manage common files like `.gitignore` from a central place <root-directory> and avoid littering the codebase with unnecessary repetitions. 

4. **Easily integrate development automation**: Manage task runner configurations and docker-compose from `<root-directory>` to easily automate repetitive workflows.

5. **Code sharing anywhere**: Easily publish and import organization-scoped libraries to the npm registry with `yarn publish` and `yarn add <@microservices-suite/foo>`.

6. **Easily containerize and scale**: Decouple every microservice to scale individually. The `no-hoist yarn workspace` feature of course with our smart scripts to package your `image` enables every microservice to pack all her `astronauts' ðŸš€ suite to land and explore the moon` ðŸ˜Ž.

## Technologies Used
  
- **Yarn Workspaces**: Simplifies managing multiple packages within a single repository, encouraging code sharing, reducing code duplication, and making it easier to handle dependencies and scripts.

- **Docker Containers**: Provides lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient containers for packaging and deploying microservices.
  
- **Kubernetes (k8s)**: Offers automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, ensuring reliability and scalability.


# Getting Started

Welcome to our project! To ensure a smooth setup and development experience, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Docker:** For containerization and managing containerized applications.[Install docker hereðŸ‘‰](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- **Task Runner Automation Tool:** For task automation and workflow management.[Install task runner hereðŸ‘‰](https://taskfile.dev/installation/).
- **Node.js:** As the runtime environment for executing the application code.

## Running Services

This project uses a Task Runner Automation Tool to streamline the process of starting services in both development and production. Follow these steps to get your environment up and running:

### Production

To run a service in production:

```bash
task:start:<service_name>
```

This command utilizes docker-compose to orchestrate containers and set up necessary networks using the docker-bridge default network.

### Development
For development purposes, use the following command to start a service, substituting <service_name> with the desired service:

```bash
task:dev:<service_name>
```

The task runner will handle the setup, ensuring your service is ready for development.

### Running Services Without Docker
If you prefer not to use Docker, you can start services using alternative methods:

- - For Production: Start the service with the PM2 engine by running:
#### task vanilla:start:<service_name>
- - For Development: Use the Nodemon node engine for a more development-friendly environment:

#### task vanilla:dev:<service_name>

Using Docker-Compose Directly
Should you need to use docker-compose directly for more control over the container orchestration, you can utilize the standard commands provided by Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up
docker-compose down
```
