# Microservices Suite

## Overview

Welcome to the Microservices Suite project! This suite is a collection of microservices built using the monorepo strategy built on top of yarn workspaces concept. It utilizes Docker containers and Kubernetes for orchestration, providing a scalable and efficient solution for various application needs.

## Features

This suite includes the following microservices:

1. **Enforce DRY principles**: Collocating code encourages code sharing, reduce code duplication as in multi-repo strategy and save time to scaffold a microservice by building on existing boiler plate or reusable functionaliy.

2. **Collaboration**: Learning by reading code authored by others as you work within the same repository its easier to kick bad habits and pick up some good ones from your peers.

3. **Hoist common development chores**: Manage common files like `.gitignore` from a central place <root-directory> and avoid littering the codebase with unnecessary repetitions. 

4. **Easily integrate developmnent automation**: Manage task runner configurations and docker-compose from <root-directory> to easily automate repetitive workflows.

5. **Code sharing anywhere**: Easily publish and import organization-scoped libraries to npm registry with `yarn publish` and `yarn add <@microservices-suite/foo>`.

6. **Easily containerize and scale**: Decouple every microservice to scale individually. `no-hoist yarn workspace` feature ofcouse with our smart scripts to package your `image` enables every microservice to pack all her `austronaut ðŸš€ suite to land and explore the moon` ðŸ˜Ž.

## Technologies Used
  
- **Yarn Workspaces**: Simplifies managing multiple packages within a single repository, encouraging code sharing, reducing code duplication, making it easier to handle dependencies and scripts.

- **Docker Containers**: Provides lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient containers for packaging and deploying microservices.
  
- **Kubernetes (k8s)**: Offers automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, ensuring reliability and scalability.
